### In this project we will be tasked to prepare storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress. WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with MySQL or MariaDB as its backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

#### This project consists of two parts:

##### Configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS. The focus of this part is to give practical experience of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.

##### Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server. This part of the project will solidify skills of deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.

#### Three-tier Architecture :

##### Generally, web, or mobile solutions are implemented based on what is called the Three-tier Architecture.

##### Three-tier Architecture is a client-server software architecture pattern that comprise of 3 separate layers.

##### Presentation Layer (PL): This is the user interface such as the client server or browser on your laptop.
##### Business Layer (BL): This is the backend program that implements business logic. Application or Webserver
##### Data Access or Management Layer (DAL): This is the layer for computer data storage and data access. Database Server or File System Server such as FTP server, or NFS Server

##### In this project, we will have the hands-on experience that showcases Three-tier Architecture while also ensuring that the disks used to store files on the Linux servers are adequately partitioned and managed through programs such as gdisk and LVM respectively.
